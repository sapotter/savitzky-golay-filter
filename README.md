#### Abstract: as it appears at code.google.com/archive/p/savitzky-golay-filter

Savitzky-Golay filter is well-known method for smoothing data. The most accurate
description I've found is in Numerical Recipes. My implementation does not follow exactly
theirs - it does not use FFT for instance, but still gives fairly impressive results. I'v
also prepared extensive documentation and few unit tests. In the library you can also
find few helpers for data pre-processing, which you can attach to filter, to assist with
common data preparation chores such as:
* linearizing
* padding
* eliminating zeros
* de-trending

Please refer to docs for more. Filter usage is fairly simple:
```
float[] data = new float[] { 8916.81f, 8934.24f, 9027.06f, 9160.79f, 7509.14f };
float[] leftPad = new float[] { 8915.06f, 8845.53f, 9064.17f, 8942.09f, 8780.87f };
double[] coeffs = SGFilter.computeSGCoefficients(5, 5, 4);
ContinuousPadder padder1 = new ContinuousPadder();
SGFilter sgFilter = new SGFilter(5, 5);
sgFilter.appendPreprocessor(padder1);
float[] smooth = sgFilter.smooth(data, leftPad, new float[0], coeffs);
MeanValuePadder padder2 = new MeanValuePadder(10, false, true);
sgFilter.removePreprocessor(padder1); sgFilter.appendPreprocessor(padder2);
smooth = sgFilter.smooth(data, leftPad, new float[0], coeffs);
```

This library comes with dependency on commons-math. Code that depends on aforementioned,
excellent lib is used only for calculating Savitzky-Golay coefficients (which involves
solving set of linear equations) - so if someone is willing to provide replacement for
this, he will be gladly welcome. If you have any problems or notice any bug, please open
an issue. I will respond as quickly as possible. Enjoy :-)

You may also like to download plotting application, called SGFilterVis. It enables you to
visualize the effect of the filter on your data. It also gives you the ability to apply
all preprocessors and observe how they work.
